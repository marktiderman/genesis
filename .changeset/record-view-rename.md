A record's page is now a **record view**, so "workspace" can mean where the viewer is working (ADR 0004). `defineWorkspace` is `defineRecordView`, `ResourceWorkspace` is `RecordView`, `NativeResourceWorkspace` is `NativeRecordView` (with `NativeRecordViewMenu` and `getNativeRecordViewStackOptions`), and the `Workspace…` types are `RecordView…`. The components take `view` in place of `workspace`, as `ResourceView` does. The old names still work for one minor release, marked deprecated. The doctor rule `ui/record-pages-use-resource-workspace` is now `ui/records-use-record-view`: rename it in an app's config if the app sets its level. Message keys (`messages.workspace`) and default test ids (`resource-workspace`) are unchanged.
