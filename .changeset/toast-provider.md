`GenesisNativeApp` mounts `NativeToastProvider` around the screens, so `useToast()` from genesis-ui-native works on every screen without the app mounting one (it threw before). Toasts sit at the top by default, where a tab bar can't cover them; `toast={{ position, disableAnimation }}` places them and `toast={null}` leaves the provider to the app. A top toast now sits below the safe area's top (the status bar and the Dynamic Island) when a `SafeAreaProvider` is above it. `FeedbackForm` takes `sentAlert={false}` to leave the confirmation to `onSent`; the starter shows a toast after a sent report.

Features: native-app-shell, native-components, support-feedback
